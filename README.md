# PressureSystem
controls hardware to apply pressure to embryos and record video

Measurement procedure:
1. Press start: the system will open communication ports with the pressure sensor, the linear actuator, and the camera. The video should automatically start.
2. Click initialize: the actuator will reset to its original position and all pressure values will be zeroed.
3. Click balance: Apply a small holding pressure to the embryo. Adjust pressure value as necessary.
4. Adjust the red ROI box to fit around the region you want to capture on video.
5. Click measure: System will ask you to save a video, and then do the rest.

At any point you can adjust the frame rate, exposure time, and crop the ROI.
